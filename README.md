# Project 5: Public API Requests
## techDegree Unit 5 with Treehouse
 In this project, I create an app for fictional company named Awesome Startup to show 12 employees name and information by fetch JSON data from Random user generator API("https://randomuser.me/") and show them on the page. The page has search funcion which show massage when the search not found and also has pop up modal window when user click on each one of employee container. On modal window, a prev button is not show when user clicks the 1st employee and next button not show when user clicks the last employee.
